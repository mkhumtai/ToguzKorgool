# ToguzKorgool
A two-player game in the mancala family that is played in Central Asia.

## Board
The game is played on aboard with two rows of nine holes. There are two **kazna** between these rows, which are used to collect captured stones of each user. At the beginning there are nine stones in each hole, except the kazna. which are empty, so players need a total of 162 stones.

## Game
The board sides are labeled as black and white. The player sitting on the white side starts the game.

Players move alternately. A move consists of taking stones from a hole and distributing them to other holes. On the player's turn, the player takes all the stones of one of their holes (which is not a tuz) and distributes them anticlockwise, one by one, into the following holes. The first stone must be dropped into the hole which was just emptied. However, if the move began from a hole which contained only one stone, this stone is put into the next hole.

If the last stone falls into a hole on the opponent's side, and this hole then contains an even number of stones, these stones are captured and stored in the player's kazna. If the last stone falls into a hole of the opponent, which then has three stones, the hole is marked as a "tuz". There are a few restrictions on creating a tuz:

1. A player may create only one tuz in each game.
2. The last hole of the opponent (the ninth or rightmost hole) cannot be turned into a tuz.
3. A tuz cannot be made if it is symmetrical to the opponent's one.

The stones that fall into a tuz are captured by its owner. The player may transfer its contents at any time to their kazna. The game ends when a player cannot move because all the holes (which are not tuz) are empty.

When the game is over, the remaining stones which are not in the kazna or in a tuz are won by the player on whose side they are. The winner is the player who has captured mores stones in their tuz and their kazna. When each player has 81 stones, the game is a draw.
